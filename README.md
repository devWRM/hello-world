# hello-world
Doubled back to create this hello-world repository to ensure I've covered all the basic steps.

I'm WRM and I'm an aspiring web developer. So far, my skills include html, css, javascript, and git. I plan to learn react, sql, and any other languages and skills necessary to become a professional developer.
